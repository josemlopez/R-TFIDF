R-TFIDF


The tf-idf approach to quantification of a keyword’s relevance has its limits. 

For example it is easily conceivable that a word will show up in a lot of documents of the corpus and yet play a central role in of it. Or a subject is covered in several documents because it is very important – but tf-idf would penalize terms typical for this subject exactly because of that reason. 

This is why tf-idf is most certainly not the answer to everything.
